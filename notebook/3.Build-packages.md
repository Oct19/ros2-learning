# Build-ROS2-packages

1. `src` folder contains packages that you want to build using `colcon`. I have ALREADY cloned ROS2 humble offical examples from Github using:

        git clone https://github.com/ros2/examples src/examples -b humble

2. Use colcon to build example packages

    1. Install colcon

                sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions

    2. List all packages in the workspace

                colcon list

    3. Build the workspace. If your computer crashes, there could be too many packages to build. Try build the packages in multiple batches.

                colcon build --symlink-install

    4. Varify builds

                colcon test

    5. If have failed builds

                colcon build --packages-select-build-failed

    6. If you do NOT want to build a specific package place an empty file named `COLCON_IGNORE` in the directory and it will not be indexed.

3. Setup the environment to use the built packages

    1. Terminal run

                . install/local_setup.bash
                ros2 run examples_rclcpp_minimal_subscriber subscriber_member_function

    2. Open another terminal

                . install/local_setup.bash
                ros2 run examples_rclcpp_minimal_publisher publisher_member_function

4. Next step: Create your own package!

    - Create a new package based on a template

                ros2 pkg create
